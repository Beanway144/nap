            <h1>What is NAP?</h1>
            NAP stands for No Automorphisms, Please!<br />The goal is to add edges and nodes to the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph</a> to break all symmetries. The fewer added
            edges and
            nodes, the better! There's a new puzzle every day.
            <h2>What counts as a symmetry?</h2>
            In this case, a symmetry is any 'relabeling' of the nodes that maintains the structure of the graph. If we
            take
            some node, we can call the set of all nodes connected to it via some edge its neighbors. Then a symmetry of
            a
            graph shuffles some nodes around, but makes sure each node has the same neighbors. Such a symmetry is called
            an
            <i>automorphism</i>.<br />
            For example, we can label the following graph and its one symmetry.
            <img style="width: 50%" src="./graphAutEx1.png" alt="A graph G, with nodes labeled 1-5."><img
                style="width: 50%" src="./graphAutEx2.png" alt="An automorphism of G, with nodes 1 and 3 switched.">
            Sometimes, the automorphisms look like the standard symmetry we're used to—reflections and rotations—like
            how the one above looks like a reflection. But often
            it can be more subtle and not look like any geometric symmetry. For example, the following is an
            automorphism that doesn't conform to our standard notion of reflection or rotation:<br />
            <img style="width: 50%" src="./graphNonStandardEx1.png" alt="An arbitrary graph"><img style="width: 50%"
                src="./graphNonStandardEx2.png" alt="Same arbitrary graph but rotated">
            Note that the actual physical movement of the graph doesn't affect its symmetries, so the following two
            graphs are
            the same:<br />
            <img style="width: 50%" src="./GraphNonAutEx1.png" alt="An arbitrary graph"><img style="width: 50%"
                src="./GraphNonAutEx2.png" alt="Same arbitrary graph but rotated">
            so they have the same symmetries.<br />
            This is an example of a graph with no automorphisms (a winning graph!): <br />
            <img style="width:50%" src="./assymetricgraph.png" alt="an assymetric graph, ie no automorhpisms" />
            <h2>Manipulating the graph</h2>
            Click the <b>Edit</b> button, then click <b>Add Node</b> and click anywhere near the graph to add a node. To
            add
            an edge, click <b>Add Edge</b>, then drag click your cursor from one node to another. When you think you
            have a
            graph with no symmetries, click <b>Check Symmetries</b>! You get 1 point for each edge
            added and 2 points for each node added. Your goal is to minimize your score.<br />
            If a node leaves the screen by accident, you can zoom out (or in) with the navigation buttons.
            <h2>More about graph symmetries</h2>
            In fancier terms, the goal of this game is to find the minimal assymetric graph with the given graph as a
            subgraph; that is, the smallest graph with a trivial automorphism group. The trivial automorphism is the
            identity,
            so when the game says there are 2 automorphisms, for example, there is, as we defined it above, only one
            symmetry.<br /><br />
